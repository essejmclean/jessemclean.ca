title: "A Year in Review"
---

It's been a long time—roughly a year (2017–2018)—since I've written a personal blog post. In that time, a lot has happened, including a number of potential posts drafted in my notepad, most probably lost forever. Like any year, this past year has been a whirlwind of excitement with its own highs and lows. What most stands out is just how much I worked. It wasn't healthy and it didn't leave a lot of time for my personal life. In some ways, I look at this as one of the natural outcomes of running and growing one's own company, yet at the same time, what are the necessary limits to balancing a heathy lifestyle? I know I need to get better at tabling work—but what if I also just _really_ enjoy what I do? Not a terrible eternal struggle to have, I suppose.

## Loner looking forward to summer
This particularly work-heavy year has made me realize that I'm very happy being a loner. Some of my favorite times this past year were the moments where I had a clear schedule, a quiet living room, and a laptop that I could use to learn something new on. Often times the things I spent my time learning about were career related: I dove into Vue.js one weekend, Popmotion another, Gatsbyjs, studied design systems for a few months (and continue to). It really feels like a win to use those learned skills with clients now. Of course, I'm only so good at being a loner for so long, so a weekend away with friends and others spent grabbing coffee or dinner is always welcome. Summer is very exciting for those reasons and the sooner I can spent another weekend in the mountains around a campfire with friends the better. Need to breath fresh mountain air on the motorcycle again as well.

## Current interests
Lately I've been extremely interested in a few things:
1. Building a catalogue of interface components that could act as a framework for future design systems.
2. Frank Ocean's music.
3. The application of methodology from different design-oriented practices (architecture, engineering, typography) to the ongoing development of digital industry, especially related to the bridging of design and development.
4. Improving accessibility to outdoor activities in Alberta (and beyond, but start small) as I have the hunch that accessibility and the siloing of knowledge is one of the major factors limiting people's exposure to nature.
5. Finally publishing the new [Field Media Lab](https://fieldmedialab.com) website that is sorely in need of an update. Thank god it's finally moving along. I struggle building things I'm too close to as they never feel perfect.

## Notes to myself
I want to write more often and keep this blog updated, but I know that I will lapse on any promise I make to myself to do so. A blog containing any interesting content will only happen if I don't force myself into it. I know this because I've been here before.

Instead of forcing myself to write about things I don't know enough about in a vain effort to before a "thought leader" in some particular area I haven't yet decided, I'm much more keen about reading as much as I can on topics I'm interested in and studying people with far more knowledge than me. That's a message for myself that feels freeing to write and will feel even better to publish.
