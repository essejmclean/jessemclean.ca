I really like typography, and while this opinion could change, I'm of the one that typography is _the_ most important factor in design. I'm upset it took me so long to get a decent grasp on it. I'm far away from a type expert and continually practicing, reading books on the subject, and analysing the work of experts. I have learned a lot that's helped immensely though, most of which is simple and ruled-based. In the subsequent paragraphs you can learn a little about my current process and the tools I use.

As one of the leading factors in design, typography is still mostly overlooked and misunderstood by the average person, of not fault of their own—it's incredibly complex. I'm of the opinion that most people could improve their design skills tenfold by simply understanding the basics of typography, most of which I think has nothing to do with font selection (so let's get that out of the way first).

## Font selection

Good typography doesn't typically stand out, instead it complements and strengths the overall visual impact of other elements and improves the communication of information. Without surprise, weak typography is the antithesis of that and its impact to a product's quality is dramatic. Apply Comic Sans or Papyrus to a well formatted, otherwise beautiful product, letterhead, or poster and it's quality is likely to be instantly robbed; however, that's likely just a case of using a typeface for an unintended use—Comic Sans has an arguably good use in situations where children will be reading its message. I find that choosing a typeface is one of the easiest parts of my job and often doesn't matter much. Here's why:

1. A font should be used according to its intended use: sans serifs are often great for screens, serifs are good for long-form, fancy display fonts are great to draw attention.
2. Once intended use is worked out, the next question revolves around brand: how does one font make people feel compared another? Does this font pair well with another I may have selected prior?

Addressing these questions is important, but typically the easiest. It's the sort of the thing that can be iterated on over time as it falls very much into the artful, aesthetic realm of typography. Subsequent aspects of typography are much more important, as they can help make any typeface look great (so long as it's being used in an intended use case).

## Scale

Good typography typically follows a scale. This helps maintain consistency by establishing a set of rules to follow: font sizes should always fit into that scale. Using the right scale is important. There are a number of possible scales to follow. [Modular Scale](http://www.modularscale.com) is a great resource for exploring possible typographic scales.

I used to be an advocate of rigidly incremented scales, such as a 1.5x scale starting at 16px. It would go: 16px, 24px, 36px, and so on. This scale works great, but more often than not I find myself moving away from it towards the [diatonic scale of type](http://ty-p.cc). I've begun to adopt the diatonic scale partly because of the visual interest it offers, and in part because its deep history. Where there is significant history there is often significant iteration and improvement, which is certainly the case of the diatonic scale of type.

The scale goes as follows ({#}px for web sizes, {#}pt for print sizes):

* 96px / 72pt
* 80px / 60pt
* 62px / 48pt
* 48px / 36pt
* 32px / 24pt
* 28px / 21pt
* 24px / 18pt
* 21px / 16pt
* 19px / 14pt
* 16px / 12pt
* 15px / 11pt
* 13px / 10pt
* 12px / 9pt
* 11px / 8pt

Following a scale of some sort is one of the easiest ways to upgrade anyone's typography skills in no time. When in doubt, double or half a font size when changing between headings and paragraphs, never dropping too low to be unreadable—I know people _very_ guilty of this. The majority should not struggle to see something you write and options should be readily available for people who do struggle. Accessibility first.

## Spacing

Line height. Easy. Long paragraphs should typically have 1.5–1.667. Headings are usually nice at 1.2. I don't want to go in-depth on this as context matters a lot for spacing and if there is any hard and fast rule it's this: use intuition. Is it difficult to read? Did you follow other rules? Adjust line height. When in doubt follow the basic guidelines for line height above.

## Further resources

There's a number of additional sections that could be added to this (and maybe will be) but I'm still learning this stuff and have found that my comments leading here include the rules that I follow on a regular basis. For a deep dive, please explore the following resources—they're great.

I recommend using the tools I linked above. Here they are again:
