title: "Goodbye Hello MacBook"

I write this from the keyboard of the MacBook I adopted today. Purchased in the parking lot of a Staples from a nice enough guy who won it at a company event, it's fully spec'd out, space grey, 13-inches, and my new baby. I'm normally not the type to purchase second hand technology—too many horror stories—but the deal was too good to pass up: used twice (one of those to photograph), OG packaging with unopened charging cables, and $1,100 off the Apple Store pricetag. Win.

Somewhat surprisingly, I'm upset about giving up my old MacBook because, normally, I'm not the sentimental type. It got me through university, is the machine I started my career on, and has been used nearly everyday (honestly) throughout the 6–7 years I've owned it. Honestly, I drove the poor thing into the ground. By the end, I was restarting it a few times a day just to try to refresh the processor and I was beginning to get some bizarre bugs, freezing, and extreme input lag. Why didn't I replace it sooner? I really enjoy getting as much as I can out of my devices. I recently heard the analogy of "using a vise-grip to squeeze a lemon" and I think that perfectly describes the relationship I have with my devices (e.g., had an iPhone 5 for six years before replacing it). 

It's sad to see my old MacBook go. It was _without a doubt_ the best purchase I've ever made. Hoping the same can be said of this one.
